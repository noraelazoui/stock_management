## 🎓 Key Concepts

### What is PyInstaller?
Converts Python scripts into standalone executables. Your clients don't need Python installed.

### What is Inno Setup?
Creates professional Windows installers with:
- Installation wizard
- File copying
- Shortcut creation
- Service installation
- Clean uninstallation

### What is MongoDB Service?
Database runs as a Windows service:
- Starts automatically with Windows
- Runs in background
- No user intervention needed

### Why ZIP MongoDB (not MSI)?
- Can bundle with your app
- No separate installation needed
- Full control over configuration
- Portable and self-contained

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Easy Customizations:

**Change App Name**:
```ini
# In installer_setup.iss

```

**Change Version**:
```ini

#define MyAppVersion "2.0.0"
```

**Change Icon**:

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build fails with "Module not found"
**Solution**: `pip install -r requirements_build.txt`

### Issue: Inno Setup can't find files
**Solution**: Check all paths in `installer_setup.iss` are correct

### Issue: Application won't start
**Solution**: Check MongoDB service is running (Services.msc)

### Issue: Installer too large (>300 MB)
**Solution**: Normal. Includes Python runtime + MongoDB + libraries
