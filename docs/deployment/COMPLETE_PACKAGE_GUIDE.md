## 🆘 NEED HELP?

### If Inno Setup compilation fails:

Check:
1. All paths in `installer_setup.iss` use Windows format (C:\...)
2. All files exist before compiling
3. Inno Setup is version 6.0 or newer

### If installer doesn't work on client machine:

1. Check Windows version (must be Windows 10/11 64-bit)
2. Client needs administrator rights for installation
3. Antivirus might block - add exception if needed

### If application doesn't start:

1. Check MongoDB service is running (services.msc)
2. Check desktop shortcut path is correct
3. Try running as administrator
